Thank you for trying Add Water. I always appreciate receiving feedback — positive or negative or anywhere in-between.
Learning what people like and don't like gives me a lot of passion to do better and helps to guide the project toward improvement.

I would love to know what you thought about the app. Feel free to tell me in whatever format works best for you, but I have some starter questions to get you going.

* What did you like?
* What did you not like?
* Does Add Water provide enough value for you to continue using it in the future?
* Was the experience of using Add Water polished and cohesive — both in form and function?
* What do you wish was different about the app?
 
Feel free to answer as many of those questions as you wish.

Thanks again for leaving feedback. Write your thoughts below, in whatever writing style or structure works for you.
