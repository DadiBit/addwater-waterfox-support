# Add Water
### An installer for the fantastic GNOME for Firefox theme by [Rafael Mardojai CM](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme)

This app allows you to automatically install the Firefox GNOME theme and keep it up to date, as well as easily configure the theme to your liking.

If you'd like to try it out, go [here](https://github.com/largestgithubuseronearth/addwater/releases/tag/beta-1). You can also clone the app into Builder and experiment with the code.

If you do, please let me know what you think by opening an issue and selecting the "Feedback" template.

Please remember that this app is a work-in-progress; there will be bugs and some placeholder assets. Once it's ready, it will be available on Flathub.
Please do not upload this app anywhere for users without my permission as it is not yet done and could result in data loss for users.

### Additional Notes:
* I will not support the theme's Experimental/Buggy options at this time. Users can enable those manually at about:config.
