# Add Water
### An installer for the fantastic GNOME for Firefox theme by [Rafael Mardojai CM](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme)

This app allows you to automatically install the Firefox GNOME theme and keep it up to date, as well as easily configure the theme to your liking.

This app is a work-in-progress; there will be bugs and some placeholder assets. Once it's ready, it will be available on Flathub.
Please do not upload this app anywhere for users without my permission as it is not yet done and could result in data loss for users.

If you want to tinker around regardless, you can use GNOME Builder to clone, edit, build, and run the app to try it out.
Let me know what you think and open an issue if you encounter any bugs.


### Additional Notes:
* I will not support the theme's Experimental/Buggy options at this time. Users can enable those manually at about:config.
