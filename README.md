An app to automatically download and update the GNOME style theme for Firefox made my Rafael Mardojai (link).

MINIMUM FEATURES:
* Check for new releases of the firefox theme
* Automatically download the new release and install it
* Let the user uninstall the theme
* Ability to revert to the previous version in case the current one doesn't work

NEXT FEATURES:
* Customize the theme preferences within this app
* Thunderbird support

IDEAS:
* Is it reasonable to support the vscode gnome theme?
